# Structural Design Patterns
Structural design patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures, while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

Thus making the entities flexible and efficient. By using an adapter pattern, you can:

* Simplify the complex structures.
* Promotes the reusability of code
* Improves flexibility by decoupling classes and objects
* The clear structure and entity relationships enhance maintainability and simplify modification.

# Types of Structural Design Patterns
* Adapter
* Bridge
* Composite
* Decorator
* Facade
* Flyweight
* Proxy
